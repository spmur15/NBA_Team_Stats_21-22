# NBA_Team_Stats_21-22

Code to scrape NBA team data from the current season from basketball-reference.com. Gets 100+ variables for each team including per game, total, opponent, per 100 possessions, advanced, and advanced shooting stats. The .py file will scrap the data and download it in a 'NBA_teams.csv' file. The .ipynb file has the same code broken up for easier reading, and includes code for a labeled scatter plot with the NBA teams data.
